# Guess the Language
## Web game for guessing languages displayed in text

Demo: [guessLanguage.netlify.com](https://guessLanguage.netlify.com)

### The app is built in vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. I built it like this to improve on my vanilla language skills, especially css, but I also got to train asynchronous javascript and using API's.

## API's used
- [Random user](https://api.randomuser.me "Randomuser.me") | Used for leaderboard
- [Random words](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home "Random-word-api") | Used to generate text
- [Google translate](https://rapidapi.com/googlecloud/api/google-translate1/details "Google translation Api") | Used to translate text into other languages

### I attempted using downloaded music and looping around, but it ended up being better to use a stream. Music used is live from the Lofi Girl livestream.
